        In this chapter, one can find a simple instruction on how to set up Fail2Ban for SSH logins. To begin with, we need to install the service itself:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="shell">sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade; # update system
sudo apt-get install fail2ban; # install Fail2Ban service
sudo systemctl enable fail2ban.service; # make Fail2Ban run on startup</code></pre>
    <p class="p-5">
        After the installation is complete, Fail2Ban <span class="text-sky-400" title="A Fail2ban jail is a configuration file that contains filters or arguments that protect your system or a particular service">jails</span> can be set up for your SSH server. The Fail2Ban configuration files are located in the <code>/etc/fail2ban</code> directory. Fail2Ban uses the default configuration in the <code>jail.conf</code> file. However, it is not recommended to use the default configuration files as they can be overwritten by newer updates to the Fail2Ban package. The preferred approach to creating configurations for a particular service is by creating a new configuration file in the <code>/etc/fail2ban</code> directory with the <code>.local</code> extension. Configuring it can be done by following these steps:
        <ol class="list-decimal">
            <li>Create a new file within the same directory called <code>jail.local</code>. You can then add the necessary security configurations for the sshd jail:
            <pre><code class="shell">sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local</code></pre></li>
            <li>Insert the options that Fail2Ban uses for blocking of the SSH service:
<pre><code class="apache">[sshd]
enabled = true # Jail status (true/false) - This enables or disables the jail
port = ssh # Port specification
filter = sshd # Service specific filter (Log filter)
logpath = /var/log/auth.log # What log to use
maxretry = 3 # Number of attempts to make before a ban
findtime = 300 # Amount of time between failed login attempts
bantime = 3600 # Number of seconds an IP is banned for
ignoreip = 127.0.0.1 # IP to be allowed</code></pre></li>
            <li>Restart the Fail2Ban service with the following command:
            <pre><code class="shell">sudo systemctl restart fail2ban.service</code></pre></li>
            <li>After restarting the OpenSSH server service, Fail2Ban uses this new configuration and the jail for the sshd service is activated and runs. To test this, create a new user account (i.e. "<code>dev</code>"). Attempt to log into the dev account with an incorrect password three times. After three failed attempts you are blocked from authentication for an hour.</li>
        </ol>

# Logging
# SyslogFacility determines the category within the system log where SSH messages will be written.
#   AUTH: (Default) Messages related to authentication attempts (e.g., successful/failed logins).
#   USER: Messages related to user activity (e.g., successful/failed shell executions, file transfers).
#   CONN: Messages related to SSH connections (e.g., connection establishment, termination).
#   MAIL: Messages related to email notifications (e.g., forwarded mail).
#   DAEMON: Messages related to the SSH daemon itself (e.g., startup, shutdown).
#   LOCAL0 to LOCAL7: Custom categories defined by your system administrator.

# LogLevel
# This variable controls the verbosity of the messages logged for the specified facility. Higher log levels include more detailed information.
#   QUIET: No messages are logged (not recommended for security reasons).
#   FATAL: Only critical errors that prevent SSH from functioning are logged.
#   ERROR: Errors and critical warnings are logged.
#   INFO: Informational messages about successful events (e.g., successful logins) are logged in addition to errors.
#   VERBOSE: Detailed debugging information is logged, which can be helpful for troubleshooting but might generate a large volume of logs.
#   DEBUG: Even more detailed debugging information is logged (use with caution due to potential security implications).
